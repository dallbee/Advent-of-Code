Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my participation in the Advent of Code 2017 challenge.
Given that the nature of the challenge is a race, the code has been written
hastily and without caution.

All solutions are wrapped in a simple framework to reduce coding overhead. You
can find the solutions to each problem in src/problems/. I will not release any
solution until at least 24 hours has passed since the problems have been
announced.

I have not written the code for portability. The code compiles was compiled with gcc 7.2.0 and run on x86_64 Gnu/Linux. To compile and run the code, simply:

    git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/dallbee/Advent-of-Code.git
    make
    ./solver < input/##.txt

This will yield the solutions to the problem ##. For further help, try running
with the --help flag.
